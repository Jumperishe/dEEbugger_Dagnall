# dEEbugger for NODEMCU hardware
[The original dEEbugger is an ESP8266 based keychain swiss army knife for electronics](https://gfycat.com/OrneryPlushAbalone)

I have tried to keep the same github format as the original dEEbugger Git in case S-March wishes to use any of my updates.

This patch modifies /improves the graticule: and adds other features..
It is compatible with NodeMCU hardware 

My primary use for this software is as a filament force display for 3D printers see: [Filament Force sensor](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2429390)
